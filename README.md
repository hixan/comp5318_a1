# comp5318_a1

This is an assignment for my machine learning class in my masters program.

I experimented with (and implemented) Gaussian Naive Bayes, Miltinomial Logistic Regression and k-nearest neighbours, all making use of numpy for efficiency.

The report can be found [here](/SID500407020_report.pdf) and the code can be found [here](/comp5318_assignment1).
