* Marking Criteria
** Report - 35.0 pts
*** Introduction - 5.0 pts
 - [ ] What is the aim of the study? [2]
 - [ ] Why is the study important? [3]
*** Methods - 5.0 pts
 - [ ] Describe the pre-processing techniques and classifier methods algorithms
*** Experiments and Results - 15.0 pts
 - [ ] Comparing experiment results between different algorithms (using table or graph) and produce a meaningful discussion of results from the experiment and choice of classifier methods (analysis on potential reasons for good performance or bad performance, and for training and inference time consumption).
*** Conclusion - 5.0 pts
 - [ ] Meaningful conclusion based on results, future work, and improvement suggested.
*** Presentation - 5.0 pts
 - [ ] Academic style, proper grammatical sentences, no spelling mistakes [2]
 - [ ] Good structure and layout, consistent formatting, using charts, graphs and tables to summarise data and compare results [2]
 - [ ] Appropriate citation and referencing [1].
** Code - 60.0 pts [1/5]
 - [X] Implementation of PCA [8]
 - [ ] and other pre-processing methods [2]
 - [2/3] Implement KNN and Na√Øve Bayes and a third algorithm
   - [X] KNN [10]
   - [X] NB [10]
   - [ ] third [5]
 - [ ] Fine-tune hyperparameters and comparison (showing how to select hyperparameters, separate training set to validation test and training test for fine-tuning) [15]
 - [ ] Optimizing source code such as running time[5]
 - [ ] Coding style: well organized, easily understood with inline comments and proper description of functions [5]
** Others - 5.0 pts
 At the discretion of the marker, for impressing the marker, exceeding expectation, etc. Some examples include:
 - [ ] Fast code: code runs in under 10 mins [2]
 - [ ] High accuracy: top 10 percentile or above 85% [2]
 - [X] Using Latex instead of Word [1]
** Penalties
 Code:
 - [ ] Coding cannot run [-10] for each algorithm
 - [ ] Plagiarism: Copy source code or snippets of code from the Internet or other sources [-20]. [-20] for copying important code such as the algorithm / classifier. [-5] for copying non-essential code e.g. helper function.
 Report:
 - [ ] Plagiarism: Copy report, article, book, journal, research paper or online resources without appropriate referencing and citation [-20]. [-5] per paragraph copied without paraphrasing and proper reference/citation.
 - [ ] Do not follow file naming rules for submission [-10]
 - [ ] Do not submit the correct files or correct number of files [-10]
 - [ ] Report exceeds more than 20 pages, excluding appendix and references [-10]
 - [ ] Do not include predicted results on test examples [-10]
 - [ ] Do not include hardware and software spec used for evaluation [-10]
 - [ ] Do not provide clear and detailed instructions in the report appendix on how to successfully run the code [-10]
 - [ ] Do not follow assignment instructions other than the ones already listed [-10]. [-3] per instruction not followed e.g. not splitting a subset of the training dataset for validation.
 - [ ]  Late submission [-5] for each day late
